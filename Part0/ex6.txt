# In single page app, the command document.getElementById('notes_form') instructs 
the code to fetch the form-element from the page, and to register an event handler to 
handle the form submit event. The event handler immediately calls the method e.preventDefault() 
to prevent the default handling of form submit. Then the event handler creates a new note, adds it 
to the notes list with the command notes.push(note), 
rerenders the note list on the page and sends the new note to the server with method POST.
